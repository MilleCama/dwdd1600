            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is Camille. Since I was young, I have always struggled to find a good wardrobe or know how to dress. I relied a lot in what my friends wore to school, but I soonly understood that the clothes they wore were not complementing my body shape. That is why I began to surf through the internet. The internet is full of very useful information that can help you learn more about how to dress. This is why I started this website, so <strong> people that look like me can get tips and discover their own style.</strong> I hope I can be helpful!. </p>
